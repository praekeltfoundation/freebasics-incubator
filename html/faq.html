        <h2><strong>What is Free Basics?</strong></h2>
        <p>Internet.org was launched in July 2014 as a global partnership between technology leaders, nonprofit organisations, local communities and experts, working together to bring the internet to the two thirds of the world's population that doesn't have access to it. </p>
        <p>The initiative includes a variety of projects, some of which are partnerships with mobile network operators across the globe to provide mobile subscribers with free access to a set of basic websites on their phones with no data charges. Users access these sites through their browsers, Facebook or an android app.</p>
        <p>To date, this part of the internet.org initiative has launched in 35 countries across the globe with well over 100 partners, giving users access to basic information in sectors such as Health, Education, Agriculture, Economic Empowerment, Gender Equality and more.</p>
        <p>16 Novemeber 2015 Facebook announced a new name for the Internet.org app and mobile website â Free Basics by Facebook. </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2><strong>What is the Praekelt.org Incubator for Free Basics?</strong></h2>
        <p>The Free Basics Incubator is a unique programme designed to accelerate the impact and growth of social change organisations through Internet.org and the Free Basics Platform.</p>
        <p>Praekelt and Facebook will be onboarding 100 social change organisations using the Incubator, which will pave the way for thousands more to make use of Internet.org's Free Basics Platform.</p>
        <p>Selected by an independent panel of advisors, organisations joining the incubator will be provided with access to:</p>
        <p><strong>Tools and Technical Support</strong><br>
          These are designed to make content more accessible for first-time internet users, particularly those using feature phones in resource-constrained environments. This system will allow organisations to manage and publish feature-rich content and services on the Free Basics platform. For a 12-month period, beneficiaries will also enjoy free hosting and limited technical support.</p>
          <p><strong>Content Development</strong><br>
            Praekelt.org will work with partners to analyse and adapt their existing content in order to ensure it is: suitable for delivery via Free Basics; engaging to end users; and geared to be impactful. Where necessary, Praekelt will guide partners in the creation of new content and services, which take advantage of some of the unique features of the Free Basics platform.</p>
            <p><strong>Capacity Building &amp; Leadership</strong><br>
              The team at Praekelt.org will work closely with the selected partner organisations to train them on the use of the publishing platform and a host of other tools they'll need to shift or scale up their work, from offline and online to digital and mobile. </p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2><strong>Who is funding this programme? </strong></h2>

              <h2><strong>Why are we doing this & what is the big picture?</strong></h2>
              <p>The aim of the incubator is to accelerate the growing number of organisations providing services on Free Basics, allowing over one billion current platform users to access even more life-enhancing services.</p>

              <h2><strong>What makes potential content partners interesting?</strong></h2>
              <ul>
                <li>The messaging and content that an organisation authors, or uses as one of its tools for impact, fits into at least one of the seven pillars listed above.</li>
                <li>The organisation has specific and proven expertise, and insight into the communities in which it works. </li>
                <li>The organisation is able to support its online messaging with programmes where its target market can participate in real life, in the territory or territories in which the organisation operates.</li>
                <li>The organisation has a vested interest in engaging its intended target market via mobile; the target audience has adequate access to mobile data, and internal capacity to make the most of the opportunity.</li>
                <li>A clear commitment to the success of the Incubator programme and a perceived willingness to make the most of the opportunity</li>
                <li>A strong ethical track record, especially in respect of access to user data - e.g. around use of Incubator features.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2><strong>What is good content? </strong></h2>
              <p>For the Free Basics Incubator, content should: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Be digitised already, or the organisation has clear capacity to digitise it themselves.</li>
                <li>Be predominantly about the reader and his or her life; not about the organisation and its programmes (i.e. an organisation that fundraises via its current website so that it can do its work separately, is not appropriate).</li>
                <li>Have regional specificity, expert authenticity and some degree of Behaviour Change messaging </li>

              <ul>
                <li>In order to create and manage content and sustain its Free Basics Incubator mobisite, each organisation should have the capacity to: </li>
                <li>Work with us to adapt its existing content for mobile using our guidance, and that of our Mobile Content Principles document</li>
                <li>Manage, maintain and generate their own content over time and manage content on the site itself.</li>
                <li>Manage user engagement (with special attention paid to moderating comments on articles) and take steps to ensure that the safety of users is protected at all times. </li>

                <h2><strong>What additional site management is required? </strong></h2>
                <p>In order to create and manage a service and sustain an Incubator mobisite, the organisation must have capacity to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Respond to user requests or comments in a suitable timeframe.</li>
                  <li>Ensure data is securely transmitted, managed and stored.</li>

                <p><br></p>
                <h2><strong>Team requirements</strong></h2>
                <p>Potential partner organisations need a dedicated team member who takes time to engage with our platform and learn how to use it. This resource will need to update content  regularly. (Note: the time requirement is highly dependent on the amount of content provided on the platform.)</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <h2><strong>Is there a legal contract?</strong></h2>
                <p>Selected partners will be expected to agree to standard terms and conditions between the Praekelt.org and the content partner, which will outline how all parties will work together.</p>
                <p>This document will serve to outline what we will offer, as well as the commitment we require from partners who are selected for the programme. </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <h2><strong>How will training work?</strong></h2>
                <p>Once partners have been selected for the Free Basics Incubator programme, Praekelt will engage with them and organise a comprehensive training session up front to make sure they understand the Content Management System (CMS), how it works and how to use it.</p>
                <p>This will consist of a two-hour Skype-led session (that partners can break up into shorter sessions if this is preferred), during which the Relationship Manager and tech team will teach the organisation how to log in, navigate, load content and change the look of the content on the CMS. It will also teach partners how they can change their content on a regular basis, so that sites will never be static. Finally it will teach partners all available tools that the system has featured.</p>
                <p>A complete user manual will also be made accessible to partners via the platform. This can be referred back to at any time.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <h2><strong>How will ongoing support work? </strong></h2>
                <p>Support for selected candidates will include: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Access to content guidelines</li>
                  <li>Platform/CMS training (via Skype) </li>
                  <li>Content development workshops for sub-selection of candidates (20 out of 100)</li>
                  <li>Access to a helpdesk </li>
                </ul>
                <p><br></p>
                <h2><strong>What criteria are organisations shortlisted against before being submitted to the panel for evaluation? </strong></h2>

                <h2><strong>Who decides which NGOs get selected to enter the Free Basics Incubator programme?</strong></h2>
